# AI-BASED DETECTION AND LOCALIZATION OF INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSM FROM BRAIN SCANS

Intracranial aneurysms are abnormal bulges in brain blood vessels, often small and asymptomatic, affecting 0.4%–6% of the population. Women over 50 are at higher risk of rupture, which can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) can detect aneurysms as small as 2–3 mm but may miss very small lesions and is limited for surgical planning.

Detection accuracy is highest for medium-to-large aneurysms, while small aneurysms (<3 mm) are frequently missed, highlighting a key diagnostic gap.

## Data Source
The data utilized in this project is sourced from the RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection Kaggle Competition.
